     * @param {string} [options.trackUri] The uri of the sound to play as notification, can be every supported sonos uri.
     * @param {string|Track} [options.metadata] The metadata of the track to play, will be guesses if undefined.
     * @param {number} [options.delayMs] Delay in ms between commands, for better notification playback stability. Use 100 to 800 for best results
     * @param {boolean} [options.onlyWhenPlaying] Only play a notification if currently playing music. You don't have to check if the user is home ;)
     * @param {number} [options.timeout] Number of seconds the notification should play, as a fallback if the event doesn't come through.
     * @param {number} [options.volume] Change the volume for the notification and revert afterwards.
     * @param {boolean} [options.resolveAfterRevert]

     * @deprecated This is experimental, do not depend on this. (missing the jsdocs experimental descriptor)
     * @remarks This is just added to be able to test the two implementations next to each other. This will probably be removed in feature.
